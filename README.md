AVR (Arduino) microcontroller used as interface board for Pi, to read RC inputs and output motor control signals (over I2C bus).  Real-time attitude control (stabilisation) and input processing is done on the Pi in C++.  Stabilisation algorithm is two cascaded PIDs (per axis, six total), one for angular velocity (AV-PID) and one for absolute angle feeding into the AV PID.  Orientation is sensed with an MPU6050 chip from Invensence (using on-board sensor fusion). </p><p><strong>Goals:</strong> Full autonomous flight for reconnaissance, surveying farms, disaster areas, power and pipe lines, crowd monitoring, etc.  Ideally with self-organising behaviour for task completion with other drones. </p><p><strong>Why a Raspberry Pi?</strong> Higher level processing, 3G connection, web cam, etc.  Far more room to have complex code than a simple microcontroller.  Challenges are real-time execution of control loops - which I might offload to the AVR but that will remove the ability to communicate with it over I2C (because the MPU6050 uses I2C). </p><p><strong>Current status:</strong> See video below - flies well - currently adding additional sensors for autonomous flight (compass, barometer and GPS). </p><h1><a name="PICTURES_AND_VIDEO"></a>PICTURES AND VIDEO<a href="#PICTURES_AND_VIDEO" class="section_anchor"></a></h1><p>
